                    My dad has always taken care of me, he is always when I need him and 
                    also he used to help me doing my homeworks and projects some years ago, 
                    really I think he is a great father.

                    My mom, as my dad, has been in the moment I need her, she is always 
                    helping me when I have problems, and she helps me to buy the things I 
                    need in the moment I need them.

                <dt><b>Sister 1</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    This is the first that was born, she was born like two minutes before the other one,
                    and she, although is annoying and always want me to do her homework, is a good sister, 
                    because she is always paying attention to me and knows when to help me, she is a good
                    listener.
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>Sister 2</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    As the other one, she is annoying, but she knows when to bother me, she knows there are
                    moments to do it and moments not to, also she pays attention when I talk with her, so,
                    as the other one, I think she is a good listener.
